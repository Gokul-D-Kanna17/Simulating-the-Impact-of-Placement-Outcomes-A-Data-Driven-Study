# Simulating the Impact of Backlog Reduction on Placement Outcomes: A Data-Driven Study

- This project analyzes factors contributing to academic backlogs among undergraduate students to support their success and reduce barriers to campus placements. The goal is to identify at-risk students and propose interventions to improve academic outcomes and employability. This is critical because backlogs in India’s campus placement system can disqualify students from job opportunities, affecting their careers and college reputations. Understanding these factors is valuable for educators, policymakers.

## Project Overview

A detailed study was conducted on institutional academic and placement data, analyzing the effects of hypothetical backlog reductions and identifying key factors influencing job offers.

## Features

- **Backlog Impact Simulation** – Models how reducing backlogs changes placement probabilities.
- **Clear Visualizations** – Trends and effects are shown using graphs and charts.
- **Scenario Analysis** – What if no one had backlogs? What if backlogs were halved?
- **All-in-One Notebook** – From loading data to conclusion, it's all in a clean Jupyter notebook.
- **Actionable Insights** – Strategies suggested to help students improve their placement odds.
- **Future Scope Ideas** – Suggestions for expansion and additional data exploration.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, make sure the following packages are installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- skimpy
- jupyter

## Results

- **Backlogs vs Placements**: A clear negative relationship, more backlogs, fewer placements.
- **Simulation Insight**: Reducing backlog percentage by 10% boosts placement rates by approximately 2.35%.
- **Top Predictors**: Number of backlogs, CGPA, and academic discipline played a significant role in predicting placement outcomes.

## Conclusion

- Backlogs don’t just delay exams, they delay careers. Reducing them boosts placement odds and helps build institutional reputation.
- Interventions like skill-building workshops, lenient policies for genuine cases, and mentoring could significantly ease the impact.
- In short: clear the backlogs, unlock more jobs. Simple, but powerful.
